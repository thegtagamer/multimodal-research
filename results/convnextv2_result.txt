(multimodal) [adey6@gpu021 multimodal-research]$ python eval_convnextv2.py
Using a slow image processor as `use_fast` is unset and a slow processor was saved with this model. `use_fast=True` will be the default behavior in v4.48, even if the model was saved with a slow processor. This will result in minor differences in outputs. You'll still be able to use a slow processor with `use_fast=False`.

Some weights of ConvNextV2ForImageClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at facebook/convnextv2-large-22k-384 and are newly initialized because the shapes did not match:
- classifier.bias: found shape torch.Size([1000]) in the checkpoint and torch.Size([6]) in the model instantiated
- classifier.weight: found shape torch.Size([1000, 1536]) in the checkpoint and torch.Size([6, 1536]) in the model instantiated
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
